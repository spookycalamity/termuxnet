# termux-telnet-botnet
This is a telnet client I made that can run in termux

To use it you must use txt files.Dont do anything illegal,like sitiing at a cafe and use nmap or something to find bots,but if u did already then you can use my tool to command them all through telnet,and if telnet is not available, I made an ssh botnet app too.
